# Sudoku CUI Java Game
As part of my Computer Science Degree, one of my assignments was to design and build a software product - a game.

### The Design Brief
This project contains two stages:
1. In Stage 1 **(this repo)**, you will need to develop a Command-line User Interface (CUI) version of the
product. You will need to use text files to store input and output data from the program.
2. In [Stage 2](https://github.com/olafwrieden/sudoku-gui/ "Stage 2 Code"), you will upgrade the product to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) version. Meanwhile, you will include a Database component to the product, implement design patterns and include necessary unit tests.

* Must be developed using Java in the [NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.org).
* Be bug-free and feature robust error handling.
* Should be easy to build (no complex build configurations).

### Not using NetBeans IDE?
If you are not using the NetBeans IDE, you may find that the Sudoku grid does not render the red (locked cells) color correctly. I have included a fix in the [Cell.java](https://github.com/olafwrieden/sudoku-cui/blob/master/src/sudoku/Cell.java#L111) class.

```
@Override
public String toString() {
  if (this.isLocked()) {
    // Uncomment the following line if you don't use NetBeans:
    //return "[" + getUserValue() + "]";

    // NetBeans only! Print locked/generated cells in red:
    return "[" + COLOUR_RED + getUserValue() + COLOUR_RESET + "]";
  }
  return ("[" + (isEmpty() ? "_" : getUserValue()) + "]");
}
```

## Game Overview

#### Main Menu
The *Main Menu* is the very first step view presented to the player. It allows 4 possible options, to start or continue a game, to show the sudoku rules or to exit the game completely.

#### Game Menu
Inside the *Game Menu*, the user is presented with game-related options. To either place or remove a digit, exit the current game with or without saving it's state, or whether the player requires a hint (easy here, they're finite!)

#### Cell Interaction
To edit a cell, it must be specified by the user. This *Cell Interaction* restricts the user to only valid options (aligned with the traditional Sudoku rules).

#### Saving a Game
Sudoku grids may take a while to complete depending on the player's chosen difficulty level, therefore the current game can be saved, and imported next time. Careful though, only one game can be saved at a time!

#### Completed a Challenge?
After the player fills out the Sudoku grid, the challenge is over and a fun-fact is displayed.
