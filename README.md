# Sudoku CUI Java Game
As part of my Computer Science Degree, one of my assignments was to design and build a software product - a game. 

### The Design Brief
This project contains two stages:
1. In Stage 1 **(this repo)**, you will need to develop a Command-line User Interface (CUI) version of the
product. You will need to use text files to store input and output data from the program.
2. In [Stage 2](https://github.com/olafwrieden/sudoku-gui/ "Stage 2 Code"), you will upgrade the product to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) version. Meanwhile, you will include a Database component to the product, implement design patterns and include necessary unit tests.

* Must be developed using Java in the NetBeans IDE.
* Be bug free and feature robust error handling.
* Should be easy to build (no complex build configurations).
